# Version history of Node.js server for offline export of Plotly.js graphs

_(Note: This changelog focuses on the major changes between the different
versions. Therefore, it may not contain all changes. Especially smaller fixes or
improvements may be omitted.)_

As a general rule the version tries to follow the
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) scheme.
Since [Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/) is the main dependency of this
application, major version changes in Plotly.js will also trigger a major
version change in this application.


## Version 1.3.0

The version of Plotly.js is bumped from 1.57.1 to 1.58.4.

## Version 1.2.3

This is the initial release based on the ECharts server
(<https://gitlab.com/striezel/echarts-node-export-server>) that does the same
thing, just with ECharts.
